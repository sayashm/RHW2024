## Question 1
### Reading Data from mobility.csv

In this step, we read the historical occupational mobility data from the CSV file. The first column contains row names, so we specify row.names = 1 to treat them as such. We then convert the data frame into a matrix format:

```{r cars}
mobility_data <- read.csv('mobility.csv', sep = ';', row.names = 1)
mobility <- as.matrix(mobility_data, byrow= FALSE)

kable(head(mobility), caption = "Preview of Mobility Data")
```
## Question 2 
### Using Matrix Package to Create a Sparse Matrix


We load the Matrix package to handle sparse matrices. We then convert the mobility matrix into a sparse matrix, which is a more efficient storage format for matrices with many zeros.

```{r}

library(Matrix)
sparse_mobility <- Matrix(data = mobility, sparse = TRUE)

```
