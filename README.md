# Statistical Computing R - HomeWork 2024 on Mobility Matrix
## Gent University 

This repository contains R code for statistical data analysis on the **mobility** matrix, a contingency table analyzing occupational mobility. The project explores key statistical concepts, including expected values, Pearson residuals, and the chi-squared statistic, to assess independence between rows and columns.

## Contents

- **`expected()`**: Computes expected frequencies for each cell in the matrix based on row and column independence.
- **`pearson()`**: Calculates Pearson residuals for each cell, indicating deviations between observed and expected values.
- **`chisquared()`**: Computes Pearson's chi-squared statistic, summarizing the independence test for the matrix.

## Getting Started

To run the code:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sayashm/RHW2024.git`
2. Open the R project or script in RStudio.
3. Run the code sections in sequence for each statistical function.

## Files

- **R Script or RMarkdown**: Contains all code and explanations for each question.
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates key methods for contingency table analysis, with custom functions validated against Râ€™s built-in statistical tools. These functions provide valuable insights into occupational mobility and statistical independence testing.
